# Add-on tds_fa_social_media_icons

This add-on lets you add social media icons on your pages. There's another add-on doing the same job called "MrKDilkington - SVG Social Media Icons", based on SVG images for the different social media icons.

FontAwesome is a part of concrete5. So why don't utilse the social media icons embedded in FontAwesome? Exactly that's what this add-on does.

Localization is available for de_DE, feel free to add more.
